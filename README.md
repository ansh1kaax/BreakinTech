# BreakinTech
My curiosity about AI and robots started with a dubbed sci-fi movie — a robot that wasn’t human, yet could think. It felt alien, and that idea stuck with me. Years later, when I discovered ChatGPT, I began exploring how this works, what powers it, and why it feels so intelligent.

I’m not here to solve a specific problem (yet). I’m here to understand how it all works — how something non-human can reason, adapt, and evolve. AI feels like the first real "alien" we’ve built — and I want to create one someday.

I’m learning everything from scratch — from binary logic to machine learning — without a tech degree, just deep curiosity. I want to build AI that understands humans. But more importantly, I want to be someone who understood AI when it first began reshaping the world.

I hope to be remembered as the person who shifted from non-tech to tech — just because she was curious enough to ask how it works, and brave enough to start late.
